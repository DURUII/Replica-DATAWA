We propose and offer solutions to a problem termed Adaptive Task Assignment (ATA) in spatial crowdsourcing (SC), which aims to maximize the number of assigned tasks by dynamically adjusting task assignments in response to changing demand and supply. An SC framework, namely \textbf{\underline D}emand-based \textbf{\underline A}daptive \textbf{\underline T}ask \textbf{\underline A}ssignment with dynamic \textbf{\underline W}orker \textbf{\underline A}vailability windows (DATA-WA), is proposed. It consists of two phases:  task demand prediction and task assignment. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first to consider the dependency relationships between task demands in different regions. We employ a multivariate time series learning approach to predict future task demands and then adjust task assignments based on real-time and predicted task demand dynamics, as well as dynamic worker availability. An empirical study on real data confirm that our proposed framework significantly improves the effectiveness and efficiency of task assignment. In our future studies, we plan to extend our validation by conducting experiments with human participants or other real-world datasets to understand how our solutions perform in practical scenarios.
